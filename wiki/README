All files with a ".wiki" extension will appear on google code as wiki
documentation.

Wiki syntax documented here:

To see how a page will be formatted ahead of time, you can edit an
existing page on the web: 
  http://code.google.com/p/bletchley/w/edit/Overview

And then click "Preview".  However, DO NOT save pages on the web.  If
you do so, then SVN synchronization will break.  Instead, just use the
preview feature and then make the updates in this directory, which
will be automatically synched to Google.
