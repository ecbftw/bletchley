Bletchley provides a variety of tools that make black box
cryptanalysis easier by taking care of some of the more tedious
engineering challenges. Bletchley is maintained by <a href="http://vsecurity.com/">VSR</a>.
Bletchley is currently in the early stages of development, which means
documentation may be lacking.  Contributions are welcome.
