Near Term
=========

* Ciphertext block brute-force classes

* A stream ciphertext probe tool to build a map of different error messages

* A tool that behaves like http2py, but generates a POA script



Future
======

* Generalize CBC-R methods to support any block decryption oracle
  http://blog.spiderlabs.com/2013/06/cbc-r-its-not-just-for-padding-oracles.html

* Codetective
  Consider using parts of this, if useful
  https://github.com/blackthorne/Codetective

* nextrand
  - Expand capabilities to handle nextInt calls with arguments
  - Transition code to a library that could be called by Python

* Consider using an SMT solver for certain problems (linear PRNGs?)
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_Modulo_Theories

* Add tools for testing and conducting hash length-extension attacks.
  One tool: https://github.com/bwall/HashPump

* Add tool to test for LCG without knowing LCG parameters
  See: Inferring Sequences Produced by Pseudo-Random Number Generators by JOAN BOYAR

* Add Mersenne Twister attack tool
  See: http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Oct/190

* Add tools for helping one determine the character set used by
  randomly generated passwords, as well as determining the mapping
  from numbers to characters
