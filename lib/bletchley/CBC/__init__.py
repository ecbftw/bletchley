class POA:
    """This class implements padding oracle attacks given a ciphertext and
    function that acts as a padding oracle.

    The padding scheme is assumed to be PKCS#5/#7, also defined in RFC2040.
    This attack was first described in:
     "Security Flaws Induced by CBC Padding. Applications to SSL, IPSEC,
      WTLS" by Serge Vaudenay (2002)

    POA objects are not caller thread-safe.  If multiple threads need to work
    simultaneously on the same ciphertext and oracle, create a
    separate instance. POA objects can execute tasks internally using
    multiple threads, however.

         results in a correct padding upon decryption and False
         otherwise.  This function should implement the prototype:
           def myOracle(ciphertext, iv): ...
         If the initialization vector (iv) is unknown is not included in
         the ciphertext message, it can be ignored in the oracle
         implementation (though some limitations will result from this).

        block_size -- The block size of the ciphertext being attacked.
         Is almost always 8 or 16.

        ciphertext -- The ciphertext to be decrypted

        iv -- The initialization vector associated with the ciphertext.
         If none provided, it is assumed to be a block of 0's

        threads -- The maximum number of parallel threads to use during
         decryption.  If more than one thread is used, then the oracle
         function will be called in parallel.  It should implement any
         internal locking necessary to prevent race conditions where
         applicable.

        decrypted -- If a portion of the plaintext is already known (due
         to a prior, partially successful decryption attempt), then this
         may be used to restart the decryption process where it was
         previously left off.  This argument is assumed to contain the
         final N bytes (for an N-byte argument) of the plaintext; that
         is, the tail of the plaintext.
