class CBCREncryptionOracle:
    '''
    This class implements an encryption oracle based on a decryption oracle.
    The decryption oracle must implement a decrypt_block method, which given an input ciphertext
    block returns the corresponding plaintext block.
    
    The technique used is known as CBC-R and was described by Juliano Rizzo and Thai Duong in 
    their BlackHat 2010 presentation "Practical Padding Oracle Attacks".
